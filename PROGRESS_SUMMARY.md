# Arkansas Registry Processor - Progress Summary

## Project Status (as of 2025-05-26)
- Mac GUI app is fully functional and processes Excel files end-to-end.
- ChromeDriver and Selenium integration confirmed (Chrome 137, ChromeDriver 137).
- Disclaimer is accepted using JavaScript force-click after scrolling to the bottom.
- Output file is generated with real search results.
- Minimal/basic GUI mode is used for maximum compatibility on macOS.
- Robust error handling and logging implemented.
- All code and documentation are up to date.

## Key Features
- **Excel Input:** Reads first name (col B), last name (col D), and gender (col G) from .xlsx files (data starts at row 4).
- **Automated Web Search:** Uses Selenium to search the Arkansas Sex Offender Registry, handling disclaimers and dynamic content.
- **Result Detection:** Distinguishes between "no results found" and "warning" (match found) using HTML selectors.
- **Output:** Results saved to Excel with timestamp, including original data and search result.
- **GUI:** Modern tkinter interface with file upload, progress tracking, status logging, and error handling.
- **Cross-Platform:** Mac and Windows support, with PyInstaller build system for Windows executable.
- **Testing:** Scripts and test files for local and automated testing.

## Next Steps
1. Test in headless mode (re-enable in `gui/registry_processor.py`).
2. Update GUI for improved layout and cross-platform compatibility.
3. Final testing with full Excel files and edge cases.
4. Build and test Windows executable, then deploy to users.
