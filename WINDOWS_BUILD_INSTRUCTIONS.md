# Building Windows Executable - Instructions

## Current Status
The executable has been successfully built, but it was created on macOS and **will not run on Windows**. You need to build the Windows executable on a Windows machine.

## What's Ready
✅ All GUI application code is complete and tested  
✅ Build system is working and tested  
✅ PyInstaller configuration is correct  
✅ Documentation is generated automatically  

## To Create Windows Executable

### Option 1: Build on Windows Machine
1. **Copy project to Windows machine**:
   ```
   Copy the entire ar-registry-processor folder to a Windows computer
   ```

2. **Install Python on Windows**:
   - Download Python 3.9+ from python.org
   - During installation, check "Add Python to PATH"

3. **Install ChromeDriver on Windows**:
   ```cmd
   # Download ChromeDriver for Windows from:
   # https://chromedriver.chromium.org/
   # Place chromedriver.exe in project root or add to PATH
   ```

4. **Build executable**:
   ```cmd
   cd ar-registry-processor
   pip install -r requirements_gui.txt
   python build_executable.py
   ```

5. **Result**: Creates `dist/Arkansas_Registry_Processor.exe` (Windows executable)

### Option 2: Test Current macOS Build Structure
The current build created:
- `dist/Arkansas_Registry_Processor` (macOS executable - 24.2 MB)
- `dist/README.txt` (User documentation)

**Structure is correct, just need Windows build.**

## For Testing on Windows

### Immediate Testing Option
You can test the GUI application directly without building executable:

1. **Copy project files to Windows**
2. **Install requirements**:
   ```cmd
   pip install pandas selenium openpyxl
   ```
3. **Install Chrome browser**
4. **Download ChromeDriver for Windows**
5. **Run directly**:
   ```cmd
   python gui/main_app.py
   ```

### ChromeDriver Setup for Windows
The application will look for ChromeDriver in these locations:
1. `chromedriver.exe` in the same directory as the executable
2. `chromedriver.exe` in the project root
3. ChromeDriver in system PATH

**Download from**: https://chromedriver.chromium.org/downloads
**Version**: Must match your Chrome browser version

## Distribution Ready
Once built on Windows, the `dist/` folder will contain:
- `Arkansas_Registry_Processor.exe` - Main application
- `README.txt` - User instructions
- Everything needed for distribution

## Current State Summary
✅ **GUI Application**: Complete and functional  
✅ **Processing Engine**: Headless mode working  
✅ **Build System**: Ready and tested  
✅ **Documentation**: Complete  
❌ **Windows Executable**: Needs Windows build environment  

The application is 100% ready - just needs to be compiled on Windows to create the `.exe` file.

## Alternative: Cross-Platform Build
If you have access to GitHub Actions or similar CI/CD, I can help set up automated Windows builds.
