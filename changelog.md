## [Unreleased]
- **Mac GUI app now fully functional:**
  - Successfully processes Excel files and outputs results.
  - ChromeDriver and Selenium integration confirmed working (Chrome 137, ChromeDriver 137).
  - Disclaimer button is now reliably accepted using JavaScript force-click after scrolling to the bottom.
  - Output file is generated with real search results.
- **Robust error handling for disclaimer acceptance.**
- **Minimal GUI mode tested for maximum compatibility on macOS.**
- **Manual and automated tests confirm end-to-end workflow.**
- Successful Windows executable build via GitHub Actions.
- Added webdriver_manager to requirements and ensured it is bundled in the build.
- Implemented PyInstaller hook for webdriver_manager to resolve module import issues.
- Updated documentation for new build and troubleshooting process.

## Next Steps
1. **Test in headless mode:**
   - Re-enable headless Chrome in `gui/registry_processor.py`.
   - Ensure the JavaScript force-click works in headless mode.
   - Confirm output is correct and no stacktrace errors occur.
2. **Update GUI:**
   - Restore or improve modern card-based layout and styles.
   - Ensure compatibility with both Mac and Windows.
   - Test all user interactions and error handling.
3. **Final testing:**
   - Test with full Excel files and edge cases.
   - Confirm robust error handling and user feedback.
4. **Build Windows executable:**
   - Use GitHub Actions or a Windows machine to build the `.exe`.
   - Test the executable on a Windows system.
   - Update documentation for Windows deployment.

## How to Resume Work
- Review this changelog and `USAGE_GUIDE.md` for current state and setup.
- Start with headless mode testing in `gui/registry_processor.py`.
- Continue with GUI improvements and cross-platform testing.
- Proceed to Windows packaging and deployment.

**All code and documentation are up to date as of 2025-05-26.**

- Added `scripts/extract_names_v1.py` to extract first and last names from columns B and D of `docs/NEWAdultstotheDatabaseinlastMonth.xlsx`.
- Output is saved to `data/extracted_names_v1.csv`.
- This script is standalone and does not affect main project files.
- Updated `scripts/search_registry_v1.py` to read First Name, Last Name, and Gender from the new Excel file `data/NEWAdultstotheDatabaseinlastMonth.xlsx` (columns B, D, G; data starts at row 4).
- The script now processes the first two valid rows for testing, but can be easily adjusted to process the entire file.
- For each entry, the script:
  - Enters the name and gender into the Arkansas Sex Offender Registry website.
  - Clicks Search and waits for results.
  - If a `<div class="no-result">No results</div>` is present, records 'no results found'.
  - If a `<div class="col-12 col-md-auto text-center text-start-md">` (results card) is present, records 'warning'.
  - Results are saved to `data/registry_results_v1.csv` with columns: First Name, Last Name, Gender, Result.
- The script is robust to blank rows and uses precise selectors for all fields and result detection.
- **HEADLESS MODE CONFIRMED**: Created `scripts/search_registry_headless_v1.py` with headless Chrome configuration. Successfully tested and confirmed that the script can run completely headless without opening a browser window. Added additional stability arguments for headless operation:
  - `--headless` for headless mode
  - `--disable-gpu` for headless stability
  - `--window-size=1920,1080` to set consistent window size
  - `--disable-web-security` and `--disable-features=VizDisplayCompositor` for additional headless compatibility
  - Enhanced console output for better monitoring during headless operation
  - Results saved to `data/registry_results_headless_v1.csv`
- **GUI APPLICATION IMPLEMENTED**: Created complete Windows-compatible GUI application in `gui/` directory:
  - `gui/main_app.py`: Modern tkinter GUI with card-based layout, progress tracking, and status logging
  - `gui/registry_processor.py`: Core processing engine adapted from headless script with callback support
  - `gui/test_gui.py`: Test script for local development and testing
  - **Features**:
    - File upload via browse dialog with Excel (.xlsx) filtering
    - Real-time progress display: "Processing: John Smith (15/100)"
    - Modern card-based UI with Microsoft-style button design
    - Background threading to prevent GUI freezing
    - Comprehensive status logging with timestamps
    - Automatic output to Excel format with formatting and column auto-sizing
    - Start/Stop processing controls
    - "Open Results" button to launch Excel file
    - Error handling and user-friendly error messages
    - Default save location to Desktop with timestamp
  - **Build System**: 
    - `build_executable.py`: Automated build script using PyInstaller
    - `requirements_gui.txt`: GUI-specific dependencies
    - Creates standalone Windows executable: `Arkansas_Registry_Processor.exe`
    - Includes documentation and user instructions
    - ChromeDriver path detection for Windows vs Mac/Linux
  - **Processing Features**:
    - Reads entire Excel files (not just first 2 rows)
    - Processes all valid names with First Name + Last Name
    - Exports results with processing timestamp
    - Excel output with auto-formatted columns
    - Robust error handling continues processing on individual failures
- **BUILD SYSTEM COMPLETED**: Successfully tested PyInstaller build process, creates 24.2MB executable with all dependencies included. Generated macOS executable for testing build system - Windows executable requires Windows build environment.
- Created `WINDOWS_BUILD_INSTRUCTIONS.md` with complete instructions for creating Windows executable
- Build creates complete distribution package: executable + README.txt user documentation
- **Ready for Windows deployment**: All code complete, just needs compilation on Windows machine
- Next steps: Build Windows executable, test on Windows systems, deploy to end users, gather feedback for improvements.
