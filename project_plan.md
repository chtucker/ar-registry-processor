# Name Processing System Project Plan

## Project Overview
Create a system that can:
1. Accept an .xls file containing names
2. Process each name through the Arkansas Sex Offender Registry website (https://sexoffenderregistry.ar.gov/public/#/name)
3. Collect relevant information returned by the website
4. Generate a report with the results

## Components Needed

### 1. Document Processing Module
- Function to read and parse .xls files
- Support for both .xls and .xlsx formats for flexibility
- Name extraction and validation
- Column mapping configuration for flexible input formats
- Data sanitization and validation

### 2. Website Interaction Module
- Function to handle website requests to sexoffenderregistry.ar.gov
- Rate limiting to prevent server overload
- Error handling and retry logic
- Session management
- Data extraction from website responses
- Respect for website's terms of service and rate limits

### 3. Report Generation Module
- Function to create structured reports
- Support for Excel output format (.xlsx)
- Error logging and tracking
- Summary statistics and processing results
- Secure storage of sensitive data
- Clear labeling of data source and timestamp

### 4. Main Application
- User interface for file upload
- Progress tracking
- Error handling and reporting
- Configuration management
- Secure handling of sensitive data
- Clear usage guidelines and disclaimers

## Technical Requirements
- Programming Language: Python (recommended for web scraping and data processing)
- Required Libraries:
  - `requests` for website interaction
  - `pandas` for data processing
  - `beautifulsoup4` for HTML parsing
  - `openpyxl` for Excel file handling
  - `xlrd` for .xls file support
  - `python-dotenv` for configuration management
  - `selenium` for handling dynamic web content

## Implementation Phases

### Phase 1: Setup and Basic Structure
- Create project structure
- Set up virtual environment
- Create configuration file
- Implement .xls file reading functionality
- Add input validation for Excel files
- Set up secure data handling protocols

### Phase 2: Website Interaction
- Implement website connection using Selenium
- Create name processing function
- Add error handling and retry logic
- Implement rate limiting
- Add proper delays between requests
- Handle CAPTCHA if present

### Phase 3: Report Generation
- Create Excel report template
- Implement data formatting
- Add error logging
- Create output file generation
- Add data source citations
- Include timestamp and processing metadata

### Phase 4: User Interface
- Create simple web interface
- Add Excel file upload functionality
- Implement progress tracking
- Add error display
- Include usage guidelines
- Add data handling disclaimers

### Phase 5: Testing and Refinement
- Unit testing
- Integration testing
- Performance optimization
- Documentation
- Compliance verification
- Rate limit testing

## Questions to Resolve
1. What column in the .xls file contains the names to process?
2. What specific information needs to be extracted from the registry for each name?
3. Are there any specific rate limiting requirements we should implement?
4. Should we implement any additional security measures for the output data?
5. Do we need to implement any specific data retention policies?

## Next Steps
1. Confirm project requirements
2. Set up development environment
3. Begin with Phase 1 implementation
4. Create initial project structure
5. Set up version control
6. Review website's terms of service and robots.txt
